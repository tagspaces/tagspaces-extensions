# Player: React (Default Layout)

This example demonstrates setting up and customizing the Default Layout using Vidstack Player React.

The [Default Layout][default-layout] is our production-ready player UI. If you're looking for
something pre-designed and ready out of the box then this is the best option. You can easily
customize the icons, branding, colors, and components to your liking.
