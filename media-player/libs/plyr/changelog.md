## v2.0.1
- Version bump for NPM (sorry for folks who upgraded to the now deleted v1.9.0 through NPM)

# v2.0.0
This version contains several potential ***breaking changes***:

- `setup()` has been reverted to pre v1.8.0 behaviour; meaning it will return the *instance* rather than the *element*. This is because the reference to the instance is no longer added to the original element (see below).
- The reference to the `plyr` instance is now added to the media element rather than original container. This is because if a container with multiple children was passed to `setup()` the references to all instances would have been added to the container, creating issues. I would recommend using the return value from `setup()` or the new `get()` method to access the instance.
- Players will always be wrapped in their own div now - this makes `setup()` and `destroy()` cleaner. This *may* break any custom styling based on DOM position.
- Players no longer seek to 0 on 'ended' - this is to fix a bug with Microsoft Edge as it triggers 'ended' on media change for whatever reason. They'll never change ;-)

And some other changes and bug fixes:

- New `get()` method on the global plyr object to get all instances inside a container
- New API methods:
	- `getOriginal()` to get the original, *unmodified* element plyr was setup on (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo)
	- `getContainer()` to get the players outer wrapper element
	- `getMedia()` to get the players media element (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo)
	- `getEmbed()` to access the YouTube or Vimeo API directly
	- `getType()` to get the type of the player
	- `isReady()` to determine if an instance has completed setup and necessary APIs are loaded (for YouTube / Vimeo)
	- `on()` to provide an easy way to listen to events
	- `stop()` to, you guessed it, stop the player
- `destroy()` now works correctly for YouTube and Vimeo (fixes #272)
- New `destroyed` event when `destroy()` has completed (original element is passed as event.target)
- Default volume is now 10 (max) rather than 5
- Sprite is only loaded once (fixes #259)
- Fixes for Vimeo post message bugs on source change or destroy (fixes #318)
- Save caption state in storage (fixes #311)
- Added keyboard shortcuts to the current focused player (with `keyboardShortcuts` boolean option to disable) (fixes #309)
- Fix for captions bug (fixes #332)
- Change to AMD (fixes #298)

## v1.8.2
- Fixed event bubbling

## v1.8.1
- Fixed inaccurate log message

# v1.8.0
- ***(Important)*** `setup()` now returns the element Plyr was setup on rather than the `plyr` object. This means `var player = plyr.setup()[0];` would now be `var player = plyr.setup()[0].plyr;`. This improves support for React and other virtual dom frameworks as mentioned in #254
- Fixed using a relative URL for `iconUrl` in IE (fixes #269)

# v1.7.0
- SASS cleanup (fixes #265)
- Docs tidy up to help quick start (fixes #253)
- Fix for issues with data attribute options passing (fixes #257)
- ***(Important)*** Removed the requirement for a wrapper div to setup Plyr and removed the dependency on the `plyr` classname as a JS hook. By default it will now look for `<video>`, `<audio>` and `[data-type]` elements. If you are just calling `setup()` with a `<div class="plyr">` you may want to give it a good test after upgrading. You can probably remove the wrapper div. The reason behind this is to make setup easier for newcomers and prevent the styling being used on unsupported players (because the plyr classname was used as a CSS and JS hook - which isn't ideal)
- Renamed the 'docs' folder to `demo` to avoid confusion - the readme is the docs after all

	- A large play button can now be overlaid over videos
	- Default number of control buttons reduced
	- New play, pause, rewind and fast forward icons
	- Flexbox all the things!
- Tidied up the LESS (and SCSS) as part of the above, variables and mixins in seprate files amking customization and upgrades easier
- Toggle mute bug fix; if a player was muted previously and the user refreshed, unmuting would have meant volume was still zero (effectively muted), now the config default value is used. Not ideal but good for now
- New `iconUrl` option allowing specifying a same origin SVG sprite location. Loading this way means you don't need the AJAX sprite loading JavaScript
- `click` option renamed to `clickToPlay` to make it a bit more self explanatory. Unfortunately cross origin SVG sprites is not supported in any browser yet :-(
- `hideControls` is now a global option, rather than being exclusive to fullscreen. Controls are now hidden after 2 seconds of no mouse movement. Controls are always shown when media is paused or stopped. This is defaulted to true.
